## What is the Dr. Cat Compute Challenge?
An idea that came to me working late at night - what is the most resource-efficient method to calculate the largest prime expressible as the sum of three cubes?

## Submission Guidelines
Find a way to do it better than the last user? Awesome! Submit a pull request with system specs, compute times, and the code you've written. All languages are fair game - even if you have to make them! Name your sumbission file (or directory) in the following manner:

`<Your Alias>-<Day/Month/Year>-<Iteration of Submission for the Day as a Letter>`

If more than 26 submissions from the same user occur in the same day, the letters stack. For instance, `AA`.

For a submission to be valid, it must:
- Be more resource-efficient than the current submission.
- Calculate a larger prime than the current submission.

All submissions will run off of whatever computing resources Repl.it is using for their "Free" plan at any given time.
